<p><em>CargoFax Trade Intelligence | January 5, 2026 | ~20 min
read</em></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The U.S. trade deficit hit $982
billion in the first nine months of 2025—but 100% of the year-over-year
increase came from Q1 tariff frontloading. Q2 and Q3 actually
<em>improved</em> compared to 2024.</p>
<p>The first nine months of 2025 produced a U.S. trade deficit of
<strong>$982 billion</strong>—up $110 billion from 2024. But the
headline figure obscures a more nuanced story: the entire year-over-year
deficit increase occurred in Q1, driven by anticipatory importing ahead
of expected tariffs. Q2 and Q3 actually showed year-over-year
improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Q1 Frontloading:</strong> Imports surged 25% in Q1 as
gold, pharmaceuticals, and electronics flooded into U.S. ports ahead of
anticipated tariffs. Q2 and Q3 normalized, with the deficit actually
shrinking compared to 2024.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The China Collapse:</strong> Chinese computer imports
fell 63% year-over-year, with monthly flows dropping 92% from January to
September. Supply chains that began relocating in 2019 appear to have
completed their transition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The AI Hardware Boom:</strong> Taiwan computer imports
grew 171% ($33.5B increase) driven by AI server demand. Mexico (+83%)
and Vietnam (+117%) also surged as the “China+1” strategy
matured.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Golden Shuffle:</strong> Switzerland shipped $47.8
billion in precious metals to the U.S. in 2025 vs. $3.8 billion in
2024—then saw significant reverse flows as tariff uncertainty
resolved.</p></li>

<h1 id="part-summaries">Part Summaries</h1>
<p><strong><a href="#part-i-the-numbers">Part I: The
Numbers</a></strong> YTD 2025 imports reached $2.60 trillion (+7.3%),
exports $1.61 trillion (+4.3%), producing a $982 billion deficit
(+12.6%). The critical insight: all $110 billion of the YoY deficit
increase occurred in Q1; Q2 and Q3 combined improved by $68 billion
versus 2024.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-ii-the-golden-shuffle">Part II: The Golden
Shuffle</a></strong> U.S. precious metal imports from Switzerland
exploded from $3.8 billion to $47.8 billion, concentrated almost
entirely in Q1. Tariff uncertainty drove institutional repositioning; by
Q2-Q3, flows normalized and significant reverse exports occurred as the
situation clarified.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-iii-the-pharmaceutical-frontloading">Part III:
The Pharmaceutical Frontloading</a></strong> Hormone imports surged from
$9.6 billion to $57.9 billion YTD, with Ireland accounting for 97% of
the total. Novo Nordisk’s expanded Irish manufacturing and Section 232
investigation fears drove a Q1 inventory build for GLP-1 drugs like
Ozempic and Wegovy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-iv-the-ai-hardware-boom">Part IV: The AI
Hardware Boom</a></strong> Computer imports grew $67.5 billion (+66%) as
AI infrastructure demand accelerated. Taiwan led with 171% growth
($53.1B total), followed by Mexico’s “silicon supply loop” (+83%) and
Vietnam’s continued China+1 momentum (+117%).</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-v-the-china-collapse">Part V: The China
Collapse</a></strong> Chinese computer imports fell from $26.9 billion
to $10.0 billion (-63%), with monthly flows dropping from $3.9B in
January to $300M in September. Cumulative tariffs exceeding 100%, UFLPA
enforcement, and completed supply chain relocations drove the shift.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-vi-india-rises">Part VI: India
Rises</a></strong> India phone/network equipment imports grew 155% to
$16.5 billion, making it the fourth-largest source. Apple’s Foxconn
Chennai facility is now exporting iPhones to the U.S. in meaningful
volumes—a strategic hedge against China exposure.</p>
<p><strong><a
href="#part-vii-energy-flows-and-nuclear-diversification">Part VII:
Energy Flows and Nuclear Diversification</a></strong> U.S. LNG exports
reached $121.6 billion (+36%), cementing America’s role as Europe’s
primary supplier post-Russia. Kazakhstan uranium imports showed notable
Q3 growth as utilities diversify away from Russian nuclear fuel.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-viii-the-critical-minerals-scramble">Part
VIII: The Critical Minerals Scramble</a></strong> Copper imports nearly
doubled to $25.9 billion as electrification demand accelerates. Notable:
DRC went from $0 to $1.65 billion as the Kamoa-Kakula mine reached full
production, diversifying supply beyond Chile.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-ix-the-q3-policy-environment">Part IX: The Q3
Policy Environment</a></strong> Key developments: Federal Circuit upheld
Section 301 tariffs (now legally permanent), UFLPA added
copper/lithium/steel to enforcement priorities, and the U.S.-EU
Framework Agreement exempted generic pharmaceuticals from reciprocal
tariffs.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-x-stories-requiring-verification">Part X:
Stories Requiring Verification</a></strong> ML anomaly detection flagged
extreme percentage increases from tiny baselines—including Slovenia
blood products (+6M%) and South Korea copper (+173,000%). These require
BOL verification before drawing conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#part-xi-outlook--q4-2025-and-beyond">Part XI:
Outlook</a></strong> Q1 inventory builds will suppress gold and pharma
imports through mid-2026. AI hardware demand shows no slowdown. The
China computer transition appears complete; the question is whether
phones and other electronics follow the same trajectory.</p>
<h1 id="introduction-a-year-unlike-any-other">Introduction: A Year
Unlike Any Other</h1>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> 2025 was not a story of steadily rising
deficits—it was a tale of three quarters. Q1 saw massive frontloading
ahead of tariffs. Q2 and Q3 normalized, with deficits actually improving
year-over-year.</p>
<p>In January 2025, shipping containers were stacking up at the Port of
Los Angeles and warehouse managers across the country were scrambling to
find storage space for incoming goods. At the time, it wasn’t entirely
clear what was driving the surge. Looking back at the data, the patterns
that emerged over the following months tell a story of strategic
repositioning, policy anticipation, and technological
transformation.</p>
<p>The first nine months of 2025 produced a trade deficit of $982
billion—an increase of $110 billion over the same period in 2024. That
headline figure, however, obscures a more complex narrative. This was
not a story of steadily rising imports overwhelming American exports.
Instead, it was a tale of three distinct quarters: a January-to-March
surge that saw importers moving goods ahead of anticipated tariffs; an
April-to-June normalization as that surge unwound; and a
July-to-September period where the composition of trade began shifting
even as totals moderated.</p>
<p>This report examines what we found in the data, the stories that
emerged, and what it might mean for the year ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Total imports hit $2.60 trillion
(+7.3%), exports reached $1.61 trillion (+4.3%), producing a $982
billion deficit (+12.6%). But the quarterly breakdown reveals the real
story: Q1 was an anomaly.</p>

<p>The first quarter of 2025 produced a quarterly trade deficit of $426
billion—up 71% from Q1 2024’s $248 billion. According to <a
href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/the-u-s-trade-deficit-has-nearly-doubled-this-year/">Bureau
of Economic Analysis data</a>, as a share of GDP, Q1 2025’s deficit was
the highest in at least 17 years.</p>
<p>Imports surged 25.5% year-over-year—an increase of $192 billion in a
single quarter. The monthly pattern showed the frontloading clearly:
January, February, and March all came in well above their 2024
counterparts.</p>
<p>Exports, meanwhile, grew a modest 3%. This wasn’t export
weakness—$523 billion is a healthy quarter—but compared to the import
surge, it was modest. The result: a deficit that grew by $177 billion,
or 71%, in a single quarter.</p>
<p>What drove this? There are likely many factors, but three stood out
when we looked at the data: precious metals, pharmaceuticals, and
electronics. Importers across these industries appear to have moved
goods into the country ahead of expected tariff increases. We’ll explore
each of these stories in detail below.</p>

<p>And then, almost as suddenly as it began, the surge ended.</p>
<p>Q2 imports were essentially flat year-over-year—up just $6 billion,
or 0.7%. After the Q1 spike, imports returned to more normal levels. The
frontloading inventory had arrived; normal purchasing resumed.</p>
<p>But here’s a number worth noting: exports jumped 6.2%, adding $32
billion to the top line. American liquefied natural gas (LNG) flowed to
Europe. Pharmaceutical ingredients shipped to European formulators.
Computer components moved to Mexican assembly plants. Aircraft
deliveries continued their post-pandemic recovery.</p>
<p>The result: the trade deficit actually shrank by $27 billion compared
to Q2 2024. After one of the worst quarterly deficits in recent memory,
the very next quarter showed year-over-year improvement. The underlying
trade position was healthier than the Q1 headlines suggested.</p>

<p>Q3 confirmed that Q2 was not a fluke. Imports actually declined
year-over-year—down $21 billion, or 2.5%.</p>
<p>Exports continued growing, adding another $20 billion. The deficit
shrank by $41 billion—a 12.4% improvement over Q3 2024.</p>
<p>But Q3 wasn’t simply “more normalization.” Beneath the headline
numbers, structural shifts were underway. Taiwan computer imports surged
as AI server demand accelerated. China computer imports collapsed as
supply chains completed their transition. Vietnam and Mexico continued
gaining share. The composition of trade was changing even as the totals
moderated.</p>

<p>Exports grew in every quarter: +$15 billion, +$32 billion, +$20
billion. That’s $67 billion in export growth across nine months—a solid
performance that received less attention than the Q1 import surge.</p>
<p>This pattern doesn’t look like structural trade deterioration. It
looks more like a one-time frontloading event followed by
normalization—and on the export side, steady improvement. The question
is: what exactly was frontloaded, and by whom?</p>
<p>When we dug into the commodity-level data, three categories stood out
as likely drivers of the Q1 surge.</p>

Gold Imports from Switzerland Surge 1,145% to $47.8 Billion in 2025</h2>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Switzerland precious metal imports
exploded from $3.8 billion to $47.8 billion, concentrated almost
entirely in Q1 2025. Tariff uncertainty drove institutional
repositioning; the Zurich-JFK air route became one of the most valuable
cargo corridors in the world.</p>
<h3 id="switzerland-and-the-precious-metals-surge">Switzerland and the
Precious Metals Surge</h3>
<p><strong>Macro context:</strong> <em>HS 7115 (Articles of Precious
Metal)</em> covers fabricated gold, silver, and platinum products—the
kind of refined precious metals that trade between central banks,
institutional investors, and refineries. In a typical year, the United
States imports roughly $7-10 billion of these products, primarily from
Switzerland (home to the world’s largest gold refineries), the United
Kingdom, and Canada.</p>
<p>2025 was not a typical year.</p>
<p>Total U.S. imports of precious metal articles reached $75.1 billion
in the first nine months of 2025, compared to $6.8 billion in the same
period of 2024. That’s an increase of $68.3 billion. Switzerland alone
accounted for $47.8 billion of the 2025 total, up from $3.8 billion in
2024.</p>
<p>The surge was concentrated in Q1. By Q2 and Q3, Swiss precious metal
imports had returned to more normal levels of a few hundred million per
month.</p>
<h3 id="the-zurich-jfk-gold-rush">The Zurich-JFK Gold Rush</h3>
<p>One striking aspect of this movement: most of the gold came by air,
not sea. According to <a
href="https://www.mining.com/web/traders-load-us-bound-planes-with-gold-and-silver-in-tariff-bet/">Bloomberg
reporting</a>, the Zurich-JFK route became one of the most valuable air
cargo corridors in the world during Q1 2025. Gold is typically
transported in the cargo holds of passenger aircraft, with insurance
limits capping how much can travel on a single flight. Swiss WorldCargo,
the air freight division of SWISS airlines, operates multiple daily
flights from Zurich to JFK—making this route a primary artery for the
precious metals surge.</p>
<p>At its peak, COMEX warehouses in New York absorbed approximately 25
million ounces ($79 billion notional) between December 2024 and March
2025—what some analysts called the largest quarterly inflow in exchange
history. <a
href="https://discoveryalert.com.au/gold-flow-reversal-switzerland-2025-trump-tariffs/">Logistics
data</a> indicated that one unnamed Swiss logistics firm “operated 24/7
to meet shipment deadlines,” with high-value cargo transported via
armored flights and insured convoys. The result: Zurich Airport’s cargo
operations saw unprecedented throughput during Q1, with precious metals
competing for space alongside pharmaceuticals and electronics.</p>
<h3 id="the-context-tariff-uncertainty">The Context: Tariff
Uncertainty</h3>
<p>To understand this movement, some context helps. In late 2024 and
early 2025, markets were pricing in significant tariff increases across
multiple categories. As <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/business/us-gold-market-switzerland-tariff-trump">CNN
reported in August 2025</a>, the Trump administration’s tariff campaign
ultimately included a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland—among the
highest rates for any country. The question of whether gold bars would
be covered created significant market uncertainty.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-08/us-hits-gold-bars-with-tariffs-in-blow-to-switzerland-ft-report">Bloomberg
reported</a> that a July 31, 2025 Customs and Border Protection ruling
clarified that certain gold bars would be subject to reciprocal tariffs,
“stunning traders who had assumed they would be exempted.”</p>
<p>The Swiss refineries—Valcambi, PAMP, and Argor-Heraeus among them—are
major players in the global gold market. According to the Swiss Federal
Customs Administration, Switzerland accounted for 34% of total refined
gold worldwide in 2023. When these refineries move metal at scale, it
typically reflects coordinated institutional decision-making.</p>
<h3 id="the-reverse-flow">The Reverse Flow</h3>
<p>Interestingly, U.S. gold exports to Switzerland also surged in 2025.
Exports of HS 7108 (gold, unwrought) to Switzerland grew from $7.95
billion in the first nine months of 2024 to $22.1 billion in 2025.</p>
<p>What might explain this two-way flow? There are a few possibilities:
- Swiss refineries import raw or semi-processed gold, refine it, and
re-export—so some reverse flow is normal business - Institutions may
have brought gold into the U.S. in anticipation of tariffs, then moved
some back when the tariff situation became clearer - Price arbitrage
between London, New York, and Swiss markets</p>
<p>We can’t say definitively which explanation dominates—the data shows
the flows, not the motivations. But the scale of movement in both
directions suggests this was more than routine trading.</p>
<p>By November 2025, the U.S. and Switzerland had reached a framework
agreement reducing tariffs to 15%, as <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/14/us-to-slash-tariffs-on-switzerland-to-15-from-crippling-39">Al
Jazeera reported</a>. Gold was ultimately exempted from the reciprocal
tariffs, though uncertainty persisted through much of the year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What the data shows:</strong> Precious metals added roughly
$35-40 billion to the Q1 trade deficit that subsequently normalized in
Q2-Q3. The exact motivations—tariff arbitrage, safe haven repositioning,
or routine institutional trading—are harder to pin down from trade data
alone.</p>

Ozempic/Wegovy Imports Surge 616% to $56.3 Billion in 2025</h2>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Hormone imports (HS 2937) from Ireland
exploded from $7.9 billion to $56.3 billion—a 616% increase. Ireland now
accounts for 97% of all U.S. hormone imports, driven by Novo Nordisk’s
GLP-1 drug manufacturing and Section 232 tariff fears.</p>
<h3 id="irelands-hormone-surge">Ireland’s Hormone Surge</h3>
<p><strong>Macro context:</strong> <em>HS 2937 (Hormones and
Steroids)</em> covers a broad category of pharmaceutical active
ingredients, including the semaglutide compounds that power the GLP-1
weight-loss drug revolution. In the first nine months of 2024, the
United States imported $9.6 billion of these products. In 2025, that
figure reached $57.9 billion—a $48.3 billion increase.</p>
<p>Ireland accounts for 97% of the 2025 total, with $56.3 billion in
hormone imports versus $7.9 billion in the same period last year. While
currency fluctuations and classification changes may play some role, the
timing and scale suggest something more specific: the intersection of
one company’s manufacturing expansion and one of the most successful
pharmaceutical products in recent history.</p>
<h3 id="novo-nordisk-and-the-athlone-facility">Novo Nordisk and the
Athlone Facility</h3>
<p>In December 2023, Novo Nordisk acquired a manufacturing facility in
Athlone, Ireland, as <a
href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/12/14/novo-nordisk-buys-irish-drug-manufacturing-plant-in-85m-deal/">reported
by the Irish Times</a>. The Danish pharmaceutical company had also <a
href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/novo-nordisk-submits-application-massive-manufacturing-campus-near-dublin">submitted
applications for a massive manufacturing campus near Dublin</a> in early
2024. These expansions were designed to meet surging global demand for
semaglutide-based drugs Ozempic (for diabetes) and Wegovy (for weight
loss).</p>
<p>The monthly pattern shows a clear frontloading signature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>January 2025:</strong> $8.7 billion (vs. $1.2 billion in
January 2024)</li>
<li><strong>February 2025:</strong> $8.1 billion</li>
<li><strong>March 2025:</strong> $17.3 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>That March figure alone—$17.3 billion in a single month from a single
country in a single commodity category—is a remarkably large monthly
bilateral pharmaceutical flow.</p>
<h3 id="the-policy-context-section-232-fears">The Policy Context:
Section 232 Fears</h3>
<p>Why the rush? On April 14, 2025, the Commerce Department initiated a
Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports, raising the
specter of national security tariffs on drug ingredients. Whether or not
such tariffs ever materialize, the investigation alone was enough to
trigger a frontloading response. Importers who had watched the 2018-2019
steel and aluminum tariffs unfold under similar Section 232 authority
had learned that early movers often beat the tariff window entirely.</p>
<p>The August 21 U.S.-EU Framework Agreement provided some relief,
exempting generic pharmaceuticals from reciprocal tariffs effective
September 1. But by then, the frontloading had already occurred. Q3
Ireland imports, at $13.5 billion, remained elevated but had moderated
from the Q1 frenzy.</p>
<h3 id="the-export-counterflow-italy">The Export Counterflow: Italy</h3>
<p>While Ireland shipped finished products to the U.S., American
pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturers found growing demand in Europe.
U.S. hormone exports to Italy surged from $4.6 billion in the first nine
months of 2024 to $11.6 billion in 2025, with Q3 alone seeing $5.9
billion in exports—up 430% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This reflects the global pharmaceutical supply chain’s complexity.
The U.S. produces many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that
European formulators then incorporate into finished products. Companies
like Pfizer, Merck, and specialty API manufacturers serving Italian and
other European drug makers benefited from the same GLP-1 demand wave
that drove Irish imports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What the data suggests:</strong> The pharmaceutical surge
added roughly $25-30 billion to the Q1 deficit. Unlike gold, this hasn’t
fully reversed—genuine demand for GLP-1 drugs continues—but the rate of
import growth has moderated significantly as initial inventory builds
were completed.</p>

Computer/Server Imports Grow 171% to $53.1 Billion on AI Demand</h2>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> U.S. computer imports (HS 8471) hit
$169.7 billion in 2025, up $67.5 billion (+66%). Taiwan led with 171%
growth driven by AI server demand from Quanta, Wistron, Inventec, and
Foxconn. China’s share collapsed from 40% (2023) to 6% (2025).</p>
<h3 id="taiwan-becomes-americas-compute-factory">Taiwan Becomes
America’s Compute Factory</h3>
<p><strong>Macro context:</strong> <em>HS 8471 (Automatic Data
Processing Machines)</em> covers computers, servers, and related
equipment. Total U.S. imports reached $169.7 billion in the first nine
months of 2025, up from $102.2 billion in 2024—an increase of $67.5
billion (+66%). Top source countries by 2025 share: Mexico (37%), Taiwan
(31%), Vietnam (15%), Thailand (7%), and China (6%).</p>
<p>That last number deserves attention. China, which in 2023 supplied
40% of U.S. computer imports, has fallen to just 6% of the market. But
we’ll return to China’s decline later. First, let’s examine what’s
rising.</p>
<h3 id="the-taiwan-story-ai-servers-and-the-nvidia-supply-chain">The
Taiwan Story: AI Servers and the NVIDIA Supply Chain</h3>
<p>Taiwan computer imports to the U.S. grew from $19.6 billion in the
first nine months of 2024 to $53.1 billion in 2025—an increase of $33.5
billion, or 171%. Unlike gold or pharmaceuticals, this is not primarily
a frontloading story. This is genuine demand growth driven by the
artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout.</p>
<p>The monthly progression shows sustained acceleration, not a
spike-and-crash pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>January 2025:</strong> $2.1 billion</li>
<li><strong>April 2025:</strong> $5.3 billion</li>
<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> $10.3 billion</li>
<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> $5.6 billion (moderation, not
collapse)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Q3 year-over-year change alone was $16.8 billion—the single
largest bilateral electronics flow increase of the quarter. What’s
driving it?</p>
<p>Four Taiwan-based contract manufacturers dominate global AI server
production: <strong>Quanta Computer, Wistron, Inventec, and Foxconn’s
server division</strong>. Together, they build more than 90% of the
world’s AI-optimized servers—the specialized machines housing NVIDIA’s
H100 and H200 GPUs that power everything from ChatGPT to corporate AI
deployments. When Microsoft, Google, Amazon, or Meta orders AI
infrastructure, the purchase orders flow to these Taiwan
manufacturers.</p>
<p>Nikkei Asia reported in November 2025 that Taiwan’s AI server exports
to the United States had doubled for the full year, and that Taiwan’s
total exports to the U.S. exceeded those to China for the first time in
26 years. Whether this proves to be a temporary surge or a longer-term
structural shift remains to be seen, but the scale of the reorientation
is notable.</p>
<h2 id="the-silicon-supply-loop-mexicos-nearshoring-acceleration">The
Silicon Supply Loop: Mexico’s Nearshoring Acceleration</h2>
<p>Mexico computer imports grew from $34.0 billion to $62.3 billion, an
increase of $28.4 billion or 83%. This growth reflects the continued
acceleration of electronics nearshoring, but with a twist that the raw
import numbers don’t capture.</p>
<p>U.S. computer exports to Mexico also surged—from $3.5 billion in the
first nine months of 2024 to $9.5 billion in 2025, an increase of 170%.
Q3 alone saw $5.0 billion in exports to Mexico, up 303%
year-over-year.</p>
<p>This bidirectional flow reveals what we call the <strong>“Silicon
Supply Loop”</strong>: American companies ship components (memory,
processors, subassemblies) to Mexican manufacturing facilities, where
they’re assembled into finished products and shipped back across the
border. Key facilities include Foxconn’s Guadalajara complex, Quanta’s
Monterrey operations, and manufacturing partnerships with HP and
Dell.</p>
<p>The Loop serves multiple purposes: it keeps assembly close to end
consumers (reducing shipping times), benefits from USMCA trade
preferences, and maintains American companies’ control over intellectual
property while outsourcing labor-intensive assembly.</p>
<h2 id="vietnam-china1-reaches-maturity">Vietnam: China+1 Reaches
Maturity</h2>
<p>Vietnam computer imports grew from $11.7 billion to $25.5 billion
(+117%), while phone imports (HS 8517) grew from $10.1 billion to $20.3
billion (+102%). Samsung’s massive Bac Ninh and Thai Nguyen facilities,
along with expanding Foxconn subsidiaries, continue to absorb
manufacturing capacity that once resided in China.</p>
<p>The “China+1” strategy—maintaining some Chinese production while
building alternative capacity elsewhere—has been industry standard since
the 2018 tariff escalation. What’s notable in 2025 is that the “+1” is
now often larger than the China baseline. For many product categories,
Vietnam is no longer the alternative; it’s the primary supplier.</p>
<h2 id="the-emerging-player-thailand">The Emerging Player: Thailand</h2>
<p>Thailand computer imports grew from $4.8 billion to $11.5 billion—a
140% increase that’s received relatively little attention. This reflects
Thailand’s emergence as a secondary hub for electronics assembly,
particularly for data storage equipment and server components. While
smaller than Taiwan, Mexico, or Vietnam in absolute terms, Thailand’s
growth rate suggests it may play an increasingly important role in
diversified supply chains.</p>

<h2
id="chinese-computer-imports-fall-63-as-supply-chains-complete-transition">Chinese
Computer Imports Fall 63% as Supply Chains Complete Transition</h2>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> U.S. computer imports from China
collapsed from $26.9 billion to $10.0 billion (-63%). Monthly flows
dropped 92% from $3.9B in January to $300M in September. China’s share
of U.S. computer imports fell from 40% (2023) to 6% (2025).</p>
<p>Then there’s China.</p>
<p>U.S. computer imports from China fell from $26.9 billion in the first
nine months of 2024 to just $10.0 billion in 2025—a decline of $16.9
billion, or 63%. The monthly pattern is even more dramatic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>January 2025:</strong> $3.9 billion (a temporary spike from
early-year frontloading)</li>
<li><strong>February 2025:</strong> $1.8 billion</li>
<li><strong>March 2025:</strong> $1.4 billion</li>
<li><strong>June 2025:</strong> $0.5 billion</li>
<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> $0.3 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>From $3.9 billion in January to $300 million in September—a 92%
decline in eight months. The speed of this shift is striking.</p>
<p>What might explain it? Likely a combination of factors: cumulative
Section 301 tariffs now exceeding 100% on many electronics categories,
UFLPA enforcement creating compliance challenges, and companies
completing multi-year supply chain transitions that were set in motion
back in 2019-2020.</p>
<p>The decline is not evenly distributed. China retains significant
market share in categories not yet subject to prohibitive tariffs or
where manufacturing alternatives don’t exist. Phone equipment imports
from China (HS 8517) fell from $33.8 billion to $21.5 billion—a
significant decline, but China remains the largest supplier in this
category. The transition is happening, but at different speeds in
different product categories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What the data suggests:</strong> For computer and server
manufacturing, the U.S. supply chain appears to have largely moved away
from China. Whether this pattern extends to other electronics
categories, or whether China’s remaining market positions prove more
durable, is worth watching in 2026.</p>

97% of iPhones from Foxconn’s Indian factories went directly to the
U.S.—up from 50% in 2024. Apple chartered planes to move $2 billion in
iPhones in March alone.</p>
<p>One of the less-discussed stories of 2025 is India’s emergence as a
significant electronics supplier to the United States.</p>
<p>Phone and network equipment imports from India (HS 8517) grew from
$6.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 to $16.5 billion in
2025—an increase of 155%. India is now the fourth-largest source of U.S.
phone imports, behind only the Census “Total” aggregation, China, and
Vietnam.</p>
<p>This reflects Apple’s accelerating India manufacturing strategy.
According to <a

reporting</a>, 97% of iPhones exported from Foxconn’s Indian factories
between March and May 2025 went directly to the United States—up from an
average of just 50% in 2024. The company began iPhone assembly at
Foxconn’s Chennai facility in 2017, initially for domestic Indian sales.
By 2025, Indian-assembled iPhones are being exported in meaningful
volumes to the United States.</p>
<p>The scale of the shift is striking. <a

alone, Apple reportedly chartered planes to transport $2 billion worth
of iPhones directly from India to the United States. To speed
deliveries, Apple has pressed Indian airport officials to reduce customs
clearance times at Chennai International Airport from 30 hours to 6.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> U.S. LNG exports grew 36% to $121.6

from $89.6 billion in 2024—an increase of $32.1 billion.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, home to Europe’s largest LNG import terminal at
Rotterdam, received $5.7 billion in U.S. LNG exports, up from $3.3
billion in 2024. Q3 shipments of $1.9 billion, up 88% year-over-year,

of Russian pipeline gas.</p>
<p>This is now the third full year of elevated U.S.-to-Europe LNG flows
following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. What began as emergency
energy security has become structural trade. The United States is now

<h3 id="kazakhstan-uranium-the-russia-hedge">Kazakhstan Uranium: The

<p><strong>Macro context:</strong> <em>HS 2844 (Radioactive Elements and

U.S. imports reached $10.8 billion in the first nine months of 2025,
roughly flat with 2024’s $10.5 billion. But the source composition
shifted.</p>
<p>Russia remains a significant supplier, with $853 million in
radioactive element imports. But Kazakhstan—the world’s largest uranium
producer at 43% of global output—showed notable Q3 growth. After
essentially zero imports in Q3 2024, Kazakhstan shipped $119.5 million
in Q3 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on percentages:</strong> The ML model flagged this as
a 280,987% increase. That number, while technically accurate, reflects a
near-zero 2024 baseline and obscures the more relevant fact: $119.5
million represents approximately 1% of U.S. annual uranium imports. This
is a small but significant supply chain pivot, not a market
transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shift aligns with broader U.S. efforts to reduce nuclear fuel
dependence on Russia. Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s state uranium company,
has signed long-term supply agreements with U.S. utilities including
Southern Company, Constellation Energy, and Duke Energy. The August 2025
CSIS report on Kazakhstan’s nuclear industry noted increased Western
interest in these partnerships as sanctions pressure Russian
alternatives.</p>
<p>Transportation logistics remain challenging—Kazakhstan is landlocked,
and the Trans-Caspian corridor for Western-bound exports adds cost and
complexity. But for utilities prioritizing supply security over cost
minimization, Kazakhstan offers a viable alternative to Russian
fuel.</p>

</ul>
<p>The DRC emergence reflects the country’s massive Kamoa-Kakula mine, a
joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines and Zijin Mining that has ramped to
full production. While Chinese companies maintain significant presence
in DRC copper mining, the finished copper flowing to U.S. markets
represents successful sourcing diversification for American industrial
users.</p>
<p>The South Korea flow is different—South Korea doesn’t mine copper.
This likely represents Korean refineries processing imported concentrate
and exporting refined product, similar to the Swiss gold refinery model.
The August 2025 UFLPA strategy update, which added copper to the
high-priority enforcement sectors, may be driving U.S. buyers toward
supply chains with cleaner provenance documentation.</p>

id="section-301-tariffs-upheld-uflpa-expands-to-critical-minerals">Section
301 Tariffs Upheld, UFLPA Expands to Critical Minerals</h2>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The September 2025 Federal Circuit
ruling made China tariffs legally permanent. UFLPA enforcement added
copper, lithium, and steel to high-priority sectors. Effective tariff
rates rose ~14 percentage points above 2024 baseline.</p>
<p>Trade flows don’t happen in a policy vacuum. The third quarter of
2025 saw significant tariff and trade policy developments that will
shape import patterns into 2026.</p>
<h3 id="tariff-landscape-year-to-date-summary">2025 Tariff Landscape:
Year-to-Date Summary</h3>
<p>The tariff environment in 2025 has been characterized by rapid
escalation followed by selective de-escalation. According to <a
href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61877">Congressional Budget Office
estimates</a>, the effective tariff rate for goods imported into the
United States rose approximately 14 percentage points above the roughly
2.5% baseline from a year earlier. Key developments through Q3:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 301 tariffs on China</strong> now exceed 100% on
many electronics categories, combining original List 3/4A tariffs with
additional fentanyl-related and reciprocal tariffs</li>
<li><strong>UFLPA enforcement</strong> has expanded dramatically, with
<a
href="https://www.cmtradelaw.com/2025/08/dhs-2025-uflpa-update-targets-new-industries-and-expands-entity-list/">CBP
detaining over $3.7 billion in shipments</a> since the law took
effect</li>
<li><strong>Electronics exemptions</strong> provided temporary
relief—computers, smartphones, and semiconductors were exempted from
reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, though they remain subject to Section
301 duties</li>
<li><strong>U.S.-China 90-day truces</strong> in May and August 2025
reduced bilateral tariffs from 125% to approximately 30% on most
goods</li>

<p>The September 25 Federal Circuit decision in <em>HMTX Industries LLC
v. United States</em> deserves particular attention. By affirming the
legality of the List 3 and 4A tariffs—which cover approximately $300
billion in Chinese imports—the court removed a significant source of
legal uncertainty. Companies that had maintained hope of tariff rollback
through litigation now have clarity: these tariffs are permanent absent
legislative or executive action.</p>
<p>The UFLPA expansion to critical minerals creates new compliance
burdens for copper, lithium, and steel importers. With 144 entities now
on the enforcement list (78 added in the past year), companies must
document supply chain provenance more carefully—or risk seizure at the
border.</p>

<h1 id="part-x-stories-requiring-verification">Part X: Stories Requiring
Verification</h1>
<h2 id="data-anomalies-flagged-for-bol-verification">Data Anomalies
Flagged for BOL Verification</h2>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> ML anomaly detection flagged several
flows with extreme percentage growth from tiny baselines. Slovenia blood
products (+6M%) and South Korea copper (+173,000%) require bills of
lading verification before conclusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Editorial note:</strong> Our ML-based anomaly detection
system flagged several Q3 flows that showed extreme percentage growth
from tiny baselines. Before including these in final analysis, we
recommend additional verification through Census microdata or bills of
lading analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="slovenia-blood-products-hs-3002">Slovenia Blood Products (HS
3002)</h3>
<p>The model flagged a surge from roughly $4,000 in Q3 2024 to $232.8
million in Q3 2025—a growth rate that exceeds 6 million percent. This
almost certainly reflects either a single large biologics shipment, a
classification change, or a data artifact rather than a genuine market
development. We could find no FDA approvals for Slovenian blood product
manufacturers in 2025 that would explain a flow of this magnitude.</p>
<h3 id="south-korea-copper-hs-7403">South Korea Copper (HS 7403)</h3>
<p>Growth from $174,000 to $302 million (+173,000%) requires
verification. While Korean copper refineries exist and could plausibly
be serving U.S. markets, this magnitude of shift from a near-zero base
suggests either misclassification or a single large shipment from an
unusual supply chain. BOL analysis would confirm whether this represents
sustained commercial activity or a one-time anomaly.</p>

<h1 id="part-xi-outlook-q4-2025-and-beyond">Part XI: Outlook — Q4 2025
and Beyond</h1>
<h2
id="what-to-expect-frontloading-hangover-ai-acceleration-china-transition">What
to Expect: Frontloading Hangover, AI Acceleration, China Transition</h2>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Q1 inventory builds will suppress gold
and pharma imports through mid-2026. AI hardware demand shows no
slowdown. The China computer transition appears complete—the question is
whether phones follow.</p>
<p>The first nine months of 2025 reshaped American trade patterns in
ways that will persist long after the frontloading inventory works
through the system. Several forces will shape the months ahead:</p>
<h3 id="the-frontloading-hangover">The Frontloading Hangover</h3>
<p>Gold and pharmaceutical inventories built in Q1 must be consumed
before normal purchasing resumes. Expect continued import weakness in
these categories through at least Q2 2026. The $75 billion in precious
metals and $58 billion in pharmaceuticals imported in the first nine
months of 2025 represents years of normal demand for some products.</p>
<h3 id="ai-demand-shows-no-signs-of-slowing">AI Demand Shows No Signs of
Slowing</h3>
<p>Every indication suggests the AI infrastructure buildout will
continue accelerating. NVIDIA’s guidance calls for data center revenue
to continue growing through 2026. Taiwan contract manufacturers have
announced capacity expansions. The “silicon supply loop” through Mexico
shows no signs of slowing. If anything, Q3’s moderation from Q2 peaks
appears to be seasonal rather than indicative of demand exhaustion.</p>
<h3 id="china-transition-continues">China Transition Continues</h3>
<p>The 92% decline in Chinese computer imports is unlikely to reverse.
The supply chains have moved. The question is whether similar declines
will materialize in other electronics categories where China retains
significant share, and whether Chinese companies can develop competitive
products for markets that don’t restrict their access.</p>
<h3 id="q4-events-that-shaped-the-data">Q4 Events That Shaped the
Data</h3>
<p>Several Q4 policy developments will affect Q4 2025 trade data in our
next report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>October 14:</strong> Section 232 tariffs on timber, lumber,
and derivative products took effect. Expect elevated Q4 imports of wood
products as firms frontloaded ahead of the deadline.</li>
<li><strong>October 30:</strong> U.S.-China framework agreement reached
in South Korea—fentanyl tariff reduced from 20% to 10% effective
November 10, Section 301 exclusions extended through November 2026. This
easing may moderate Q4 import declines from China.</li>
<li><strong>November 1:</strong> Section 232 tariffs on medium and
heavy-duty vehicles (25%) and buses (10%) took effect. Watch for
elevated Q3 imports and shifts in Q4 sourcing patterns.</li>
<li><strong>November 14:</strong> U.S.-Switzerland tariff reduction to
15% applied retroactively. May affect customs valuation in Q4 data.</li>
<li><strong>December 26:</strong> Canada 25% surtax on steel derivative
goods (fasteners, wire, mesh, chains) took effect. Anticipate
frontloading in Q4 and potential sourcing shifts in Q1 2026.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="conclusion-a-year-of-repositioning">Conclusion: A Year of
Repositioning</h1>
<p>What does the 2025 data tell us? At minimum, it suggests this wasn’t
simply a year of rising deficits. It was a year of
repositioning—companies and investors responding to policy uncertainty,
supply chains continuing transitions that began years earlier, and
genuine technological demand driving significant electronics flows from
a handful of key manufacturing partners.</p>
<p>The trade deficit grew. But the composition of that trade shifted in
ways that may prove significant for supply chain resilience and
diversification going forward.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions: U.S. Trade Q1-Q3 2025</h2>
<p><em>Click any question to expand the answer.</em></p>

<details>
<summary>What was the U.S. trade deficit in 2025 (through Q3)?</summary>
<p>The U.S. trade deficit reached <strong>$982 billion</strong> in the first nine months of 2025, an increase of $110 billion (+12.6%) compared to the same period in 2024. However, the entire year-over-year increase occurred in Q1—Q2 and Q3 actually improved compared to 2024.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What drove the increase in the U.S. trade deficit in 2025?</summary>
<p>The deficit increase was driven by <strong>anticipatory importing ("frontloading")</strong> ahead of expected tariffs in Q1 2025. Three categories drove most of the surge: gold from Switzerland ($68B increase), pharmaceuticals from Ireland ($48B increase), and electronics from Taiwan ($34B increase). Importers rushed goods into the country before potential tariff deadlines. Q2 and Q3 showed year-over-year improvement as frontloading unwound.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What were the top U.S. imports in Q1-Q3 2025?</summary>
<p>The largest import categories by value were: <strong>computers and data processing equipment</strong> (HS 8471, $169.7B), <strong>phone and network equipment</strong> (HS 8517, $98.1B), <strong>precious metal articles</strong> (HS 7115, $75.1B), <strong>petroleum gases/LNG</strong> (HS 2711, $60.8B), and <strong>hormones/pharmaceuticals</strong> (HS 2937, $57.9B). The pharmaceutical and precious metals categories showed the largest year-over-year increases due to frontloading.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much did U.S. imports from China decline in 2025?</summary>
<p>Chinese computer imports (HS 8471) <strong>fell 63% year-over-year</strong>, from $26.9 billion to $10.0 billion. The monthly pattern was even more dramatic: flows dropped <strong>92% from $3.9 billion in January to $300 million in September 2025</strong>. China's share of U.S. computer imports fell from 40% in 2023 to just 6% in 2025.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Which countries replaced China as top U.S. computer suppliers?</summary>
<p><strong>Taiwan</strong> became the leading growth market with 171% increase ($53.1B total), driven by AI server demand. <strong>Mexico</strong> held the largest overall market share at 37% ($62.3B, +83%). <strong>Vietnam</strong> grew 117% to $25.5B, and <strong>Thailand</strong> emerged as a new player with 140% growth to $11.5B. This reflects the maturation of the "China+1" supply chain strategy.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What caused the gold import surge to the U.S. in 2025?</summary>
<p><strong>Tariff uncertainty</strong> drove institutional investors and traders to move gold into U.S. COMEX warehouses ahead of potential import duties. Switzerland shipped <strong>$47.8 billion in precious metals</strong> to the U.S. in Q1-Q3 2025, up from $3.8 billion in 2024—a <strong>1,145% increase</strong>. The surge was concentrated almost entirely in Q1, then reversed as the Trump administration ultimately exempted gold from reciprocal tariffs.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How did gold physically enter the United States in 2025?</summary>
<p>Most gold arrived <strong>by air via commercial passenger aircraft</strong> on the <strong>Zurich-JFK route</strong>, making it one of the most valuable air cargo corridors in the world during Q1 2025. Swiss WorldCargo operates multiple daily flights on this route. COMEX warehouses absorbed approximately <strong>25 million ounces ($79 billion notional)</strong> between December 2024 and March 2025—what analysts called the largest quarterly inflow in exchange history.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happened to pharmaceutical imports from Ireland in 2025?</summary>
<p>Hormone imports (HS 2937) from Ireland <strong>surged from $7.9 billion to $56.3 billion</strong>, a 616% increase. <strong>Ireland accounted for 97%</strong> of all U.S. hormone imports in 2025. This was driven by Novo Nordisk's expanded Irish manufacturing of GLP-1 drugs like <strong>Ozempic and Wegovy</strong>, combined with frontloading ahead of a potential Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much did Taiwan's exports to the U.S. grow in 2025?</summary>
<p>Taiwan computer exports to the U.S. grew from $19.6 billion to <strong>$53.1 billion (+171%)</strong>, driven by <strong>AI server demand</strong>. Taiwan's four major contract manufacturers—<strong>Quanta, Wistron, Inventec, and Foxconn</strong>—build over 90% of the world's AI-optimized servers housing NVIDIA H100 and H200 GPUs. Unlike gold or pharma, this growth reflects genuine demand rather than frontloading.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the "China+1" supply chain strategy?</summary>
<p><strong>"China+1"</strong> refers to companies maintaining some Chinese production while building alternative manufacturing capacity in countries like Vietnam, India, Mexico, Taiwan, and Thailand. The strategy emerged after the 2018-2019 tariff escalation. In 2025, for many product categories, the "+1" country became <strong>larger than the China baseline</strong>—Vietnam is no longer the alternative; it's the primary supplier for many electronics categories.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much did Apple's iPhone exports from India grow in 2025?</summary>
<p>India phone/network equipment exports to the U.S. <strong>grew 155% to $16.5 billion</strong>. By mid-2025, <strong>97% of iPhones</strong> exported from Foxconn's Indian factories went directly to the United States, up from 50% in 2024. Apple reportedly <strong>chartered planes to transport $2 billion</strong> worth of iPhones from India in March alone. India's share of global iPhone production has risen from less than 1% in 2017 to approximately 18% in 2025.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What was the Section 301 tariff rate on Chinese goods in 2025?</summary>
<p>Cumulative Section 301 tariffs <strong>exceeded 100%</strong> on many Chinese electronics categories by 2025, combining original List 3/4A tariffs with fentanyl-related (20%) and reciprocal tariffs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the <strong>effective tariff rate rose approximately 14 percentage points</strong> above the 2.5% baseline from 2024. The September 2025 Federal Circuit ruling in <em>HMTX Industries v. United States</em> affirmed these tariffs as legally permanent.</p>
</details>

<details>

<summary>How did U.S. copper imports change in 2025?</summary>
<p>U.S. copper imports <strong>nearly doubled from $13.1 billion to $25.9 billion</strong> as electrification demand accelerated. Chile remained the dominant supplier at $7.0 billion, but supply diversified significantly—the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo went from $0 to $1.65 billion</strong> as the Kamoa-Kakula mine (a joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines and Zijin Mining) reached full production. This diversification reflects both EV battery demand and efforts to reduce Chile concentration risk.</p>
